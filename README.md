#MathsKlatch 2020 camera operator stuff

This repository contains files for the camera operator at MathsKlatch 2020.

bookmarklet.js contains a JavaScript bookmarklet which will toggle the intruding bits of the gather.town UI off, so you can capture just the speaker's video.

MathsJam_2020.obs is an OBS scene collection. One scene is configured to capture a window, and there are two other scenes containing images to switch to while fiddling with things. I don't think this will copy across to another device well, but at least it's a starting point.
